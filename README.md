## Generalized Enhancer Predictor (GEP) 

Generalized Enhancer Predictor (GEP) is a Random Forest based machine-learning tool for identification of putative enhancers using chromatin dynamics data. The Random Forest model is implemented in python. The package also contains accessary programs required for the analysis.
